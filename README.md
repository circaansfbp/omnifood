# Omnifood project

Main project developed throughout the Udemy course [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/), by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Overview

### Summary

The idea of the project was to put in practice the technologies and new knowledge obtained of web development and design (UI/UX) by developing a webpage for the fictional company "Omnifood", which provides an AI-based daily food subscription for its users.

### Technologies

This project was built using:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (CSS Grid and Flexbox)
- Javascript ES6+

The project is fully responsive, allowing its correct display on mobile devices, such as tablets and phones.
